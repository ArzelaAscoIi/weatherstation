# Weatherstation

## General Information
 

Since 1985 the Geographical Institute has had a climate measuring station, which has been operated fully automatically since 1989 ("Klimamessstation Aachen-Hörn der RWTH"). The Clima station is located in an area in the west of Aachen which is characterised by residential buildings and loosely arranged university buildings.

 

Geographical coordinates: _6° 03' 40" E, 50° 46' 44" E_

Altitude: 222m above sea level

 

The following climate elements are registered in compliance with international regulations: Air pressure, air temperature, ground temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, evaporation, global radiation, diffuse sky radiation, duration of sunshine, wind direction, wind speed and global radiation.

Special measurements are carried out at times; a 3D ultrasound anemometer is currently in operation.

The registrations of the current weather data are archived as 10-minute averages or extreme values. The data can be made available to interested parties for a fee.

The Department of Physical Geography prepares monthly reports of registrations for the (university) public on a daily basis. Among other things, they form the basis for the annual weather reports published on the station's website, which are published in abridged form in the local media in advance and are available in tabular form.

 

The station does not serve as a classical weather station in an official and/or private measuring network, but has the task to provide information about weather and climate for teaching and research in geography as well as for applications in research and technology at RWTH Aachen University. It also serves as a reference station for regional climate research projects at the Institute of Geography (Urban and Terrain Climatology).

 

The site also houses a branch of the Bensberg earthquake station. In addition, pollen measurements are currently being carried out there by the Aachen University Clionicum.

The station is especially used for the Magister and Bachelor studies in teaching.
